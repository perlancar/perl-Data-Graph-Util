 # return nodes of a graph. a must come before b, b must come before c & d, and
 # d must come before c.

 my @sorted = toposort(

 ); # => ("a", "b", "d", "c")

 # sort nodes specified in 2nd argument using the graph. nodes not mentioned in
 # the graph will be put at the end. duplicates are not removed.

 my @sorted = toposort(
     { a=>["b"], b=>["c", "d"], d=>["c"] },
     ["e", "a", "b", "a"]
 ); # => ("a", "a", "b", "e")

 # check if a graph is cyclic

 say is_cyclic ({a=>["b"]}); # => 0
 say is_acyclic({a=>["b"]}); # => 1

 # check if a graph is acyclic (not cyclic)

 say is_cyclic ({a=>["b"], b=>["c"], c=>["a"]}); # => 1
 say is_acyclic({a=>["b"], b=>["c"], c=>["a"]}); # => 0

 # return connected subgraphs, sorted by the largest
 my @subgraphs = connected_components(

 ); # => return 1 element, all nodes are connected as a single graph

 # return connected subgraphs, sorted by the largest
 my @subgraphs = connected_components(
     { a=>["b"], b=>["c", "d"], d=>["c"],
       e=>["f"],
       g=>["h", "i"], j=>["a"],
     },

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Early release. More functions will be added later.

This module provides some functions related to the graph data structure.

Keywords: topological ordering, dependency sorting, dependency ordering.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

=head2 toposort

Usage:

 toposort(\%graph[ , \@nodes ]) => sorted list

Perform a topological sort on graph (currently using the Kahn algorithm). Will
return the nodes of the graph sorted topologically. Will die if graph cannot be
sorted, e.g. when graph is cyclic.

If C<\@nodes> is specified, will instead return C<@nodes> sorted according to
the topological order. Duplicates are allowed and not removed. Nodes not
mentioned in graph are also allowed and will be put at the end.

=head2 is_cyclic

Usage:

 is_cyclic(\%graph) => bool

Return true if graph contains at least one cycle. Currently implemented by
attempting a topological sort on the graph. If it can't be performed, this means
the graph contains cycle(s).

=head2 is_acyclic

Usage:

 is_acyclic(\%graph) => bool

Return true if graph is acyclic, i.e. contains no cycles. The opposite of
L</is_cyclic>.

=head2 connected_components

Usage:

 connected_components(\%graph) => list of subgraphs

Return list of subgraphs that are not connected to one another, sorted by
descending size. If all the nodes are connected, will return a single subgraph
(the original graph itself).

=head2 Related modules

L<Graph> contains more graph-related algorithms.

=head3 Topological sort

L<Algorithm::Dependency> can also do topological sorting, but it is more finicky
with input: graph cannot be epmty and all nodes need to be specified.

L<Sort::Topological> can also sort a DAG, but cannot handle cyclical graph. It
also performs poorly and eats too much RAM on larger graphs.

See L<Bencher::Scenario::GraphTopologicalSortModules> for benchmarks.
